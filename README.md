# Nexridge

WIP serverside framework for exposing your SQL database to be queried from the client utilising knex.js library.
For now, nexridge doesn't offer authorisation, so you're left with whatever auth your DB offers.

## Usage example
See test/test-server.js for an example of usage with mysql2 on localhost

## Planned
0.2.0 authorisation - be able to restrict users from querying some DB's. For now
